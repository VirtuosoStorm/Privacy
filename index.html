<h1><span>Why Privacy is Important</span></h1>
<hr color="#000" width="50%"/>
<p>
<span>
1. Limit on Power
</span>
<br /><br />
<span>Privacy is a limit on government power, as well as the power</span><br />
<span>of private sector companies. The more someone knows about us</span><br />
<span>, the more power they can have over us. Personal data is</span><br />
<span>used to make very important decisions in our lives. Personal</span><br />
<span>data can be used to affect our reputations; and it can be</span><br />
<span>used to influence our decisions and shape our behavior. It</span><br />
<span>can be used as a tool to exercise control over us. And in</span><br />
<span>the wrong hands, personal data can be used to cause us great</span><br />
<span>harm.</span><br /><br />

<span>
2. Respect for Individuals
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>Privacy is about respecting individuals. If a person has a</span><br />
<span>reasonable desire to keep something private, it is</span><br />
<span>disrespectful to ignore that person’s wishes without a</span><br />
<span>compelling reason to do so. Of course, the desire for</span><br />
<span>privacy can conflict with important values, so privacy may</span><br />
<span>not always win out in the balance. Sometimes people’s</span><br />
<span>desires for privacy are just brushed aside because of a</span><br />
<span>view that the harm in doing so is trivial. Even if this</span><br />
<span>doesn’t cause major injury, it demonstrates a lack of</span><br />
<span>respect for that person. In a sense it is saying: “I care</span><br />
<span>about my interests, but I don’t care about yours.”</span><br /><br />

<span>
3. Reputation Management
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>Privacy enables people to manage their reputations. How we</span><br />
<span>are judged by others affects our opportunities,</span><br />
<span>friendships, and overall well-being. Although we can’t</span><br />
<span>have complete control over our reputations, we must have</span><br />
<span>some ability to protect our reputations from being</span><br />
<span>unfairly harmed. Protecting reputation depends on</span><br />
<span>protecting against not only falsehoods but also certain</span><br />
<span>truths. Knowing private details about people’s lives</span><br />
<span>doesn’t necessarily lead to more accurate judgment about</span><br />
<span>people. People judge badly, they judge in haste, they</span><br />
<span>judge out of context, they judge without hearing the whole</span><br />
<span>story, and they judge with hypocrisy. Privacy helps people</span><br />
<span>protect themselves from these troublesome judgments.</span><br /><br />

<span>
4. Maintaining Appropriate Social Boundaries
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>People establish boundaries from others in society. These</span><br />
<span>boundaries are both physical and informational. We need</span><br />
<span>places of solitude to retreat to, places where we are free</span><br />
<span>of the gaze of others in order to relax and feel at ease.</span><br />
<span>We also establish informational boundaries, and we have an</span><br />
<span>elaborate set of these boundaries for the many different</span><br />
<span>relationships we have. Privacy helps people manage these</span><br />
<span>boundaries. Breaches of these boundaries can create</span><br />
<span>awkward social situations and damage our relationships.</span><br />
<span>Privacy is also helpful to reduce the social friction we</span><br />
<span>encounter in life. Most people don’t want everybody to</span><br />
<span>know everything about them – hence the phrase “none of</span><br />
<span>your business.” And sometimes we don’t want to know</span><br />
<span>everything about other people — hence the phrase “too much</span><br />
<span>information.”</span><br /><br />

<span>
5. Trust
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>In relationships, whether personal, professional,</span><br />
<span>governmental, or commercial, we depend upon trusting the</span><br />
<span>other party. Breaches of confidentiality are breaches of</span><br />
<span>that trust. In professional relationships such as our</span><br />
<span>relationships with doctors and lawyers, this trust is key</span><br />
<span>to maintaining candor in the relationship. Likewise, we</span><br />
<span>trust other people we interact with as well as the</span><br />
<span>companies we do business with. When trust is breached in</span><br />
<span>one relationship, that could make us more reluctant to</span><br />
<span>trust in other relationships.</span><br /><br />

<span>
6. Control Over One’s Life
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>Personal data is essential to so many decisions made about</span><br />
<span>us, from whether we get a loan, a license or a job to our</span><br />
<span>personal and professional reputations. Personal data is</span><br />
<span>used to determine whether we are investigated by the</span><br />
<span>government, or searched at the airport, or denied the</span><br />
<span>ability to fly. Indeed, personal data affects nearly</span><br />
<span>everything, including what messages and content we see on</span><br />
<span>the Internet. Without having knowledge of what data is being</span><br />
<span>used, how it is being used, the ability to correct and amend</span><br />
<span>it, we are virtually helpless in today’s world. Moreover, we</span><br />
<span>are helpless without the ability to have a say in how our</span><br />
<span>data is used or the ability to object and have legitimate</span><br />
<span>grievances be heard when data uses can harm us. One of the</span><br />
<span>hallmarks of freedom is having autonomy and control over our</span><br />
<span>lives, and we can’t have that if so many important decisions</span><br />
<span>about us are being made in secret without our awareness or</span><br />
<span>participation.</span><br /><br />

<span>
7. Freedom of Thought and Speech
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>Privacy is key to freedom of thought. A watchful eye over</span><br />
<span>everything we read or watch can chill us from exploring ideas</span><br />
<span>outside the mainstream. Privacy is also key to protecting</span><br />
<span>speaking unpopular messages. And privacy doesn’t just protect</span><br />
<span>fringe activities. We may want to criticize people we know to</span><br />
<span>others yet not share that criticism with the world. A person</span><br />
<span>might want to explore ideas that their family or friends or</span><br />
<span>colleagues dislike.</span><br /><br />

<span>
8. Freedom of Social and Political Activities
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>Privacy helps protect our ability to associate with other</span><br />
<span>people and engage in political activity. A key component of</span><br />
<span>freedom of political association is the ability to do so with</span><br />
<span>privacy if one chooses. We protect privacy at the ballot</span><br />
<span>because of the concern that failing to do so would chill</span><br />
<span>people’s voting their true conscience. Privacy of the</span><br />
<span>associations and activities that lead up to going to the</span><br />
<span>voting booth matters as well, because this is how we form and</span><br />
<span>discuss our political beliefs. The watchful eye can disrupt</span><br />
<span>and unduly influence these activities.</span><br /><br />

<span>
9. Ability to Change and Have Second Chances
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>Many people are not static; they change and grow throughout</span><br />
<span>their lives. There is a great value in the ability to have a</span><br />
<span>second chance, to be able to move beyond a mistake, to be</span><br />
<span>allows people to grow and mature without being shackled with</span><br />
<span>all the foolish things they might have done in the past.</span><br />
<span>Certainly, not all misdeeds should be shielded, but some</span><br />
<span>should be, because we want to encourage and facilitate growth</span><br />
<span>and improvement.</span><br /><br />

<span>
10. Not Having to Explain or Justify Oneself
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>An important reason why privacy matters is not having to</span><br />
<span>explain or justify oneself. We may do a lot of things which,</span><br />
<span>if judged from afar by others lacking complete knowledge or</span><br />
<span>understanding, may seem odd or embarrassing or worse. It can</span><br />
<span>be a heavy burden if we constantly have to wonder how</span><br />
<span>everything we do will be perceived by others and have to be</span><br />
<span>at the ready to explain.</span><br /><br />
