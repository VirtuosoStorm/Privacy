<h1>Why Privacy is Important</h1>
<hr color="#FFFFFF" width="50%"/>
<p align="middle">
1. Limit on Power<br /><br />

Privacy is a limit on government power, as well as the power<br />
of private sector companies. The more someone knows about us<br />
, the more power they can have over us. Personal data is<br />
used to make very important decisions in our lives. Personal<br />
data can be used to affect our reputations; and it can be<br />
used to influence our decisions and shape our behavior. It<br />
can be used as a tool to exercise control over us. And in<br />
the wrong hands, personal data can be used to cause us great<br />
harm.<br /><br />


2. Respect for Individuals<br /><br />

Privacy is about respecting individuals. If a person has a<br />
reasonable desire to keep something private, it is<br />
disrespectful to ignore that person’s wishes without a<br />
compelling reason to do so. Of course, the desire for<br />
privacy can conflict with important values, so privacy may<br />
not always win out in the balance. Sometimes people’s<br />
desires for privacy are just brushed aside because of a<br />
view that the harm in doing so is trivial. Even if this<br />
doesn’t cause major injury, it demonstrates a lack of<br />
respect for that person. In a sense it is saying: “I care<br />
about my interests, but I don’t care about yours.”<br /><br />

3. Reputation Management<br /><br />

Privacy enables people to manage their reputations. How we<br />
are judged by others affects our opportunities,<br />
friendships, and overall well-being. Although we can’t<br />
have complete control over our reputations, we must have<br />
some ability to protect our reputations from being<br />
unfairly harmed. Protecting reputation depends on<br />
protecting against not only falsehoods but also certain<br />
truths. Knowing private details about people’s lives<br />
doesn’t necessarily lead to more accurate judgment about<br />
people. People judge badly, they judge in haste, they<br />
judge out of context, they judge without hearing the whole<br />
story, and they judge with hypocrisy. Privacy helps people<br />
protect themselves from these troublesome judgments.<br /><br />

4. Maintaining Appropriate Social Boundaries<br /><br />

People establish boundaries from others in society. These<br />
boundaries are both physical and informational. We need<br />
places of solitude to retreat to, places where we are free<br />
of the gaze of others in order to relax and feel at ease.<br />
We also establish informational boundaries, and we have an<br />
elaborate set of these boundaries for the many different<br />
relationships we have. Privacy helps people manage these<br />
boundaries. Breaches of these boundaries can create<br />
awkward social situations and damage our relationships.<br />
Privacy is also helpful to reduce the social friction we<br />
encounter in life. Most people don’t want everybody to<br />
know everything about them – hence the phrase “none of<br />
your business.” And sometimes we don’t want to know<br />
everything about other people — hence the phrase “too much<br />
information.”<br /><br />

5. Trust<br /><br />

In relationships, whether personal, professional,<br />
governmental, or commercial, we depend upon trusting the<br />
other party. Breaches of confidentiality are breaches of<br />
that trust. In professional relationships such as our<br />
relationships with doctors and lawyers, this trust is key<br />
to maintaining candor in the relationship. Likewise, we<br />
trust other people we interact with as well as the<br />
companies we do business with. When trust is breached in<br />
one relationship, that could make us more reluctant to<br />
trust in other relationships.<br /><br />

6. Control Over One’s Life<br /><br />

Personal data is essential to so many decisions made about<br />
us, from whether we get a loan, a license or a job to our<br />
personal and professional reputations. Personal data is<br />
used to determine whether we are investigated by the<br />
government, or searched at the airport, or denied the<br />
ability to fly. Indeed, personal data affects nearly<br />
everything, including what messages and content we see on<br />
the Internet. Without having knowledge of what data is being<br />
used, how it is being used, the ability to correct and amend<br />
it, we are virtually helpless in today’s world. Moreover, we<br />
are helpless without the ability to have a say in how our<br />
data is used or the ability to object and have legitimate<br />
grievances be heard when data uses can harm us. One of the<br />
hallmarks of freedom is having autonomy and control over our<br />
lives, and we can’t have that if so many important decisions<br />
about us are being made in secret without our awareness or<br />
participation.<br /><br />

7. Freedom of Thought and Speech<br /><br />

Privacy is key to freedom of thought. A watchful eye over<br />
everything we read or watch can chill us from exploring ideas<br />
outside the mainstream. Privacy is also key to protecting<br />
speaking unpopular messages. And privacy doesn’t just protect<br />
fringe activities. We may want to criticize people we know to<br />
others yet not share that criticism with the world. A person<br />
might want to explore ideas that their family or friends or<br />
colleagues dislike.<br /><br />

8. Freedom of Social and Political Activities<br /><br />

Privacy helps protect our ability to associate with other<br />
people and engage in political activity. A key component of<br />
freedom of political association is the ability to do so with<br />
privacy if one chooses. We protect privacy at the ballot<br />
because of the concern that failing to do so would chill<br />
people’s voting their true conscience. Privacy of the<br />
associations and activities that lead up to going to the<br />
voting booth matters as well, because this is how we form and<br />
discuss our political beliefs. The watchful eye can disrupt<br />
and unduly influence these activities.<br /><br />

9. Ability to Change and Have Second Chances<br /><br />

Many people are not static; they change and grow throughout<br />
their lives. There is a great value in the ability to have a<br />
second chance, to be able to move beyond a mistake, to be<br />
able to reinvent oneself. Privacy nurtures this ability. It<br />
allows people to grow and mature without being shackled with<br />
all the foolish things they might have done in the past.<br />
Certainly, not all misdeeds should be shielded, but some <br />
should be, because we want to encourage and facilitate growth<br />
and improvement.<br /><br />

10. Not Having to Explain or Justify Oneself<br /><br />

An important reason why privacy matters is not having to<br />
explain or justify oneself. We may do a lot of things which,<br />
if judged from afar by others lacking complete knowledge or<br />
understanding, may seem odd or embarrassing or worse. It can<br />
be a heavy burden if we constantly have to wonder how<br />
everything we do will be perceived by others and have to be<br />
at the ready to explain.<br /><br />
